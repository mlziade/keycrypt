I'd like you to create a fun trivia challenge for a friend with the following structure:

- Choose a theme that connects all three questions.
- Set a difficulty level: one of "Easy", "Medium", "Hard", or "Expert".
- Write exactly three questions, each containing:
  - A clear trivia question
  - A one-word answer
  - A hint â€” this must be a single word, no longer than 10 characters

Also include a congratulatory message shown once the trivia is completed. Keep this message:
- Related to the theme
- Casual (not too corporate, not overly whimsical)
- No more than 144 characters long

Finally, return everything in this JSON format:

```json
{
  "message": "The message after solving the trivia",
  "theme": "The theme of the questions",
  "difficulty": "Easy | Medium | Hard | Expert",
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "The question text",
      "answer": "OneWordAnswer",
      "hint": "HintWord"
    },
    {
      "question": "The question text",
      "answer": "OneWordAnswer",
      "hint": "HintWord"
    },
    {
      "question": "The question text",
      "answer": "OneWordAnswer",
      "hint": "HintWord"
    }
  ]
}
```

Inputs to use:
- Theme: "<<REPLACE_THEME>>"
- Difficulty: "<<REPLACE_DIFFICULTY>>"

Make sure the hint for each question is a single word with a maximum of 10 characters. And dont forget to fill up the answer.
